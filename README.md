Teams - http://worldcup.kimonolabs.com/api/teams?sort=name-&fields=name,logo,group,groupRank,groupPoints,matchesPlayed,wins,losses,draws,goalsFor,goalsAgainst,goalsDiff,id,type
Matches - http://worldcup.kimonolabs.com/api/matches?sort=startTime&fields=homeScore,awayScore,currentGameMinute,startTime,status,group,awayTeamId,homeTeamId,id

Ideas:
    - Add the team short code with flags to identify (If we need more room)
    - Add a drop-down section for table stats (Just show overall points to start)
    - Show/hide scores
    - Add current game minute to dashboard game listing
    - "Is there a way to click on the flags so it goes to their standings/schedule?"
    - Go right to current day in Fixtures(?)
