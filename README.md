Matches - http://worldcup.kimonolabs.com/api/matches?sort=startTime&fields=homeScore,awayScore,currentGameMinute,startTime,status,group,awayTeamId,homeTeamId,id

Ideas:
    - Add the team short code with flags to identify (If we need more room)
    - Show/hide scores
    - "Is there a way to click on the flags so it goes to their standings/schedule?"
    - Go right to current day in Fixtures(?)
